<h2>Project Setup</h2>

Follow these steps to set up the project in your development environment:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.</br>
2. Make sure you have Java 11 and MySQL installed on your system.</br>
3. Create a MySQL database named olimpyc_fisio (or any other name you prefer) on your local server.</br>
4. Configure the database credentials in the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources folder. Update the spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, and spring.datasource.password properties according to your MySQL configuration. </br>
5. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project. </br>
6. Run the following command to compile and run the application:

7. Troubleshooting Project Download Issues
If you encounter an error when downloading the project for the first time, you may need to follow these steps to resolve it:

  a. Open the `application.properties` configuration file.</br>
  b. Look for the `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` property and temporarily set it to `true`.</br>
  c. Run the project and allow Spring to automatically generate the database schema.</br>
  d. Once the database is properly configured, remember to revert the `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` property back to `false` or its original value.


8. The application will be available at http://localhost:8088. Open your browser and access that address to see it in action. </br>
